End Device for ``Access Point as Data Hub'' example


This application offers the end device functionality of the generic
SimpliciTI ``Access Point as Data Hub'' example.  Pressing buttons on the
display will toggle the corresponding LEDs on the access point board to
which this end device is linked.

The application can communicate with another SimpliciTI-enabled device
equipped with a compatible radio and running its own version of the
access point from the ''Access Point as Data Hub'' example or with other
development boards running the simpliciti_hub_ap example.

To run this binary correctly, the development board must be equipped with
an EM2 expansion board with a CC2520EM module installed in the ``MOD1''
position (the connectors nearest the oscillator on the EM2).  Hardware
platforms supporting SimpliciTI 1.1.1 with which this application may
communicate are the following:

<ul>
<li>eZ430 + RF2500</li>
<li>EXP430FG4618 + CC2500 + USB Debug Interface</li>
<li>SmartRF04EB + CC2510EM</li>
<li>CC2511EM USB Dongle</li>
<li>Stellaris Development Board + EM2 expansion board + CC2500EM</li>
</ul>

Start the board running the access point example first then start the
end devices.  The LEDs on the end device will flash once to indicate that
they have joined the network.  After this point, pressing one of the
buttons on the display will send a message to the access point causing it
to toggle either LED1 or LED2 depending upon which button was pressed.

For additional information on running this example and an explanation of
the communication between the two devices and access point, see section 3.4
of the ``SimpliciTI Sample Application User's Guide'' which can be found
under C:/StellarisWare/SimpliciTI-1.1.1/Documents assuming that
StellarisWare is installed in its default directory.
